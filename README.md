# Ising_MERA
A pedagogical code implementing a MERA-like ansatz for the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM). 

For now, the code only allows one to calculate ground state energies for 1D TFIM with periodic boundary conditions using a binary MERA ansatz in order to validate the implementation. Future plans include adding support for extraction of scaling dimensions, central charge, OPE coefficients, and correlation functions.
